# Inventory System

This code defines a basic system for managing products and warehouses, including CRUD operations and some authorization mechanisms. It utilizes the Candid interface for communication on the Internet Computer.
Functions include adding/editing products and warehouses, querying products and warehouses by ID or name, and handling product quantities.

## 1. Struct Definitions

- **Product Struct:**
  
  ```rust

  #[derive(candid::CandidType, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Default)]
  struct Product {
      id: u64,
      name: String,
      quantity: u32,
      category: String,
      warehouse: Warehouse,
      added_at: u64,
      re_stocked_at: u64,
  }
  ```

- **Warehouse Struct:**
  
  ```rust
  #[derive(candid::CandidType, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Default)]
  struct Warehouse {
      id: u64,
      name: String,
      address: String,
  }
  ```

### 2. Implementation of Storable and BoundedStorable Traits

- Both `Product` and `Warehouse` implement the `Storable` trait, which defines methods for converting instances to and from bytes.

- Both also implement the `BoundedStorable` trait, specifying a maximum size for serialization.

### 3. Thread-Local Storage

- Thread-local static variables are used for memory management and storage:
  
  ```rust
  static MEMORY_MANAGER: RefCell<MemoryManager<DefaultMemoryImpl>> = /* ... */;
  static ID_COUNTER: RefCell<IdCell> = /* ... */;
  static PRODUCT_STORAGE: RefCell<StableBTreeMap<u64, Product, Memory>> = /* ... */;
  static WAREHOUSE_STORAGE: RefCell<StableBTreeMap<u64, Warehouse, Memory>> = /* ... */;
  ```

### 4. Payload Structs

- Payload structs are defined for input data in update functions:
  
  ```rust
  struct WarehousePayload { /* ... */ }
  struct ProductPayload { /* ... */ }
  struct EditProductPayload { /* ... */ }
  struct GetProductPayload { /* ... */ }
  struct EditWarehousePayload { /* ... */ }
  struct AccessPayload { /* ... */ }
  ```

### 5. Update Functions

- Update functions modify the state. For example:

  ```rust
  #[ic_cdk::update]
  fn add_product(payload: ProductPayload) -> Result<Product, Error> { /* ... */ }
  ```

### 6. Query Functions

- Query functions retrieve data but don't modify the state:

  ```rust
  #[ic_cdk::query]
  fn get_product_by_id(id: u64) -> Result<Product, Error> { /* ... */ }
  ```

### 7. Error Handling

- An `Error` enum is defined for different error scenarios:

  ```rust
  enum Error { /* ... */ }
  ```

### 8. Candid Export

- The Candid interface is exported using `ic_cdk::export_candid!()`.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd inventory_system/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
